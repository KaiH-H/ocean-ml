## Welcome back!
Here is an image of an [Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl), which is an ocean amphibian. The ocean is freaky!

Today we are going to:
1. Resolve our issues with GitHub (hopefully once and for all)
2. Introduce fun AI application of the week
3. Start cutting our data down. 

# First:
Go to [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/madesai22/ocean-ml/blob/master/githubguide.md)

We need to fully delete and redownload our respository.

# Next
Review what we did last class. In Sublime, open the file `session-10-29-review.py.` With a partner, answer the questions, save and run your code in the terminal. 

Best practices tip: Save your code after each question and run it in the terminal before writing the answer to the next question.

# Next
Fun AI Application of the week!

Quick, Draw! with Google [Link](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com)

Questions:
* Try drawing the items with as little detail and as few lines as possible. Is the AI able to guess what you are drawing? 
* What happens when you draw a really detailed drawing?
* What objects are easier for the algorithm to recognize? Which are harder?
* Now look at the data: [link](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data)

# Now
We are going to work on cutting our data down from the full globe to what we need to work with!
[link to guide](https://github.com/madesai22/ocean-ml/blob/master/cutting_data.md)

With a partner:
* What are some of the variables we need as inputs?
* What do we want our output to look like?
* Try to map out an idea of how we can go from inputs to outputs
