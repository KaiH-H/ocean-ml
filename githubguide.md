GitHub Guide 

1. Log into GitHub on your browser and navigate to (https://github.com/madesai22/ocean-ml)

2. Navigate to the right side of the window and click "Fork." This will save a new copy of the repository in your GitHUb account

3. Open Terminal. Decide where you want to store your GitHub resository on your computer, and navigate to that place. I made a folder in my Documents called "InternGit", and I store this respository there. 
* Remember: to make a directory use <span style="font-family:Courier New">mkdir /path/to/directoryname </span>
